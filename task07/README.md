# Task 7

## Problem

The tasks this round consist in downloading today’s “linux-next kernel”, build it, and boot it.

*Hint:* refer to the Linux kernel is development process in `Documentation/development-process/` in
the kernel source itself.



## Solution

### File Description

- `README.md`: This file as readme.



### Environment

This task is conducted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Linux kernel version 4.12.0.



### Procedure

1. Download the most recent [Linux release](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/snapshot/linux-50c4c4e268a2d7a3e58ebb698ac74da0de40ae36.tar.gz) in `/usr/src` and unzip it there. 
2. Build, install the modified source and reboot the system.




## Trivia

- I installed Linux 4.15-rc3 and then removed it because I am quite afraid of `rc`. 
- Linux contributors are mainly working on visualization.
