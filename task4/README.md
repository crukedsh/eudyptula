# Task 4

## Problem

Part of the job of being a kernel developer is recognizing the proper *Linux kernel coding style*. The full
description of this coding style can be found in the kernel itself (`Documentation/CodingStyle`). There
is also a tool (`checkpatch.pl` in the `scripts` directory) available from the kernel source tree.
The task for this round consists in refactoring the module from the first task such that it meets the
requirements of the Linux kernel coding style.

*Note:* it is important that everyone follow the same standard so that the patterns become consistent. In
other words, you want to make it really easy for other people to find the bugs in your code, and not be
confused and distracted by other unimportant things (e.g. prefer spaces instead of tabs for indentation).
