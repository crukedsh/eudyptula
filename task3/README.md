# Task 3

## Problem

The task for this round is to take the kernel git tree from Task 2 and modify the `Makefile` as well as the
`EXTRAVERSION` field. Do this in a way that the running kernel (after modifying the `Makefile`, rebuilding,
and rebooting) displays "ve482hobby" in the version string. Prepare a patch for the modified `Makefile`.

*Hint:* refer to the file `Documentation/SubmittingPatches`.
